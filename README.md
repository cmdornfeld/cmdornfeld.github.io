# PROJECT NAME

HTML Resume

## Description

As part of the application process for [Prime Digital Academy](https://primeacademy.io/), I had to turn my paper resume into a HTML/CSS resume, viewable on the web.  I did not have any experience coding prior to attempting this, so it was a bit of a struggle.  After a couple Codecademy(https://www.codecademy.com/) courses, and about 15 hours of work, this is what I created.
